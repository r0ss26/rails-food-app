AFTERNOON CHALLENGE
Core:

Guess what...time to create another rails app!

Create a new app, called foods, using postgresql (or sqlite3) as our database

Foods should have a name and a number of calories

Create the routes to make a full CRUD resource for foods

Create a controller for foods, with all necessary methods

Create the views for foods

For CREATE and UPDATE, we will need to implement a form!

We should be able to:

view all foods

view one food

update a food

delete a food

Advanced:

After completing the CRUD resource, make it look pretty with some styling

Expert:

Already done? Add in another CRUD resource for beverages

Beverages are similar to food, they have name and number of calories, but also an addition attribute, is_alcoholic which is a boolean
